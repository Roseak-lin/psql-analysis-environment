# psql-analysis-environment

This project is the setup for the postgresql environment. 

To start, download all 7 .tsv.gz files from [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) and add them all to the empty `DB` directory

Next, this project requires the `psycopg2` dependency, which can be installed by running 
```
pip install psycopg2-binary
```



After this is done, run the `initialize.py` file.
